# What This Project Does
This project implements a Doubly Linked List in Java. A doubly linked list is a linear data structure where each node contains pointers to both its previous and next nodes, allowing bidirectional traversal. It includes several key features to manage and manipulate the list effectively.
# Features of the Project
Node Structure:

Each node stores:
An integer value (value).
A pointer to the next node (next).
A pointer to the previous node (prev).
Operations Provided:

Add: Adds a new node with a specified value at the end of the list.
Remove: Removes the first node with a given value, updating neighboring nodes to maintain the list structure.
Reverse: Reverses the order of nodes in the list by swapping the next and prev pointers.
Print: Prints the values of all nodes from the head to the tail.
Delete List: Deletes the entire list by setting the head and tail pointers to null.
Testing Utility:

Includes a helper method to print the list into a StringBuilder for testing purposes.
How to Run It
Environment Setup:
